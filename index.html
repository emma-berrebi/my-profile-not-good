          Hi there! I'm Emma Berrebi, a first-year student at ESSEC BBA. 
          Born in Paris and raised by a multicultural family, I am the youngest of a 4-children family. I am franco Israeli and I'm 18 years old. More than being a multicultural family, I'm from a family full of artists. From singers and pianists, to drawers and painters, my family and I live a life full of surprises. 
          Since I was little, I have been sharing the passion for music and for the stage with my family. I sing and I play piano but what I love the most is to play in musicals.

        <h2>Animation ‚úçÔ∏è</h2>
        <p>
          I am passionate by animation.
          I was rocked by the wolrd of Disney and it become a huge part of my life. I know everything about this univers. Whether it is the movies, the characters or the songs, my brother and I know everything! I have the chance to have a brother who works in that field. Indeed, he is an animator and he studied at Les Gobelins which is one of the best animation school! I'm really thankful to him for teaching so many things on the cinema and he animation.

        <h2>Music üé§</h2>
        <p>
          I've always loved music and thanks to my family, it has always been a huge part of my life. My mother is a lyric singer and since I'm little, I've seen her singing and playing many roles in beautiful places like Les Invalides.  When I grew up, I've began to be as passionate as she is. Now, I'm used to sing and to play in musicals. I had the first role on musicals several times sush as Mamma mia, Grease or Flashdance. moreover, I had the chance to record a song with people that went on the show The Voice. It was a great experience!

        <h2>Travel ‚úàÔ∏è</h2>
        <p>
          As a member of a multicultural family, I think that travelling is one of the most important thing. It is a really big enrichment. It permits to grow up, to learn so many things on yourself and on the others. When I travel, I'm always surprised. I discover thousands of things, whether it is the architecture, the way of life or the traditions.

        <h2>Voice dubbing üéô</h2>
        <p>
         As a huge fan of animation, I've always wanted to do a voiceover audition and, of course, to pass the audition. Two years ago, my dream came true and I did the voiceover on a short animation movie. I played a psychologist and it was really fun to act this character. Now I can't wait to have another oppotunity like that. The ideal would be to do the voiceover on a Disney character and to sing the songs that everybody know.
